# PLEASE READ 
This is a selenium bot which helps you to check people who don't follow back you on Instagram. It basically looks up the elements shown in the browser (Chrome or Firefox) by locating their xpaths or names or IDs. 
In the end it prints out the account names who don't follow back your account. 

# IMPORTANT 
- This needs to be Python version 3.7 or up
- Username and password need to be changed for the bot to log in to your account.
